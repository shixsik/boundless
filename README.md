# boundless
The Boundless Prover Node is a computational proving system that participates in the Boundless decentralized proving market. Provers stake USDC, bid on computational tasks, generate zero-knowledge proofs using GPU acceleration, and earn rewards for successful proof generation.
### Requirements
Hardware
CPU - 16 threads, reasonable single core boost performance (>3Ghz)
Memory - 32 GB
Disk - 100 GB NVME/SSD
GPU
Minimum: one 8GB vRAM GPU
Recommended to be competetive: 10x GPU with min 8GB vRAM
Recomended GPU models are 4090, 5090 and L4.
You better test it out with single GPUs by lowering your configurations later by reading the further sections.
Software
Supported: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04
No support: Ubuntu 24.04
